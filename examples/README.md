This file provides users detailed examples of how to use our interface and what they can do with the interface.
## Getting Started
Our interface mainly consists of three parts: regional heat map, filter options and line graphs.
### Regional Heat Map
Regional heat map summarizes and aggregates data within pre-defined hundreds of neighborhoods in New York City. Initially, it displays the neighborhood names and community district boundaries. Without making any selections, users can have a general overview of what kind of information they can have from heat map by simply hover over it.

### Filter Options
The filter options allow users to select a certain period they feel they are most interested in. Fliters include one slider and two dropdown menus. The initial value for hour is 0, month is april and date is 1. Users can select either some of the fliters or all of the fliters. If only some of fliters are selected, then the others will keep their initializing defaults.
